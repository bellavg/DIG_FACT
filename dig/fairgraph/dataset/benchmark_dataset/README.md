## Congress Benchmark Data 


### Usage
This dataset can be used for analytical 
studies, such as assessing the correlation 
between net worth and political affiliations,
the diversity of educational backgrounds, or the
representation of states. It is also suitable for 
sociological studies into gender distribution and 
religious beliefs among political figures. We utilized it to test graph fairness while predicting the
average net worth of congress members based on their demographic factors. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** Using names, gender, age, and political affiliation
in this context will  introduce or amplify biases
based on gender, ethnicity, or other personal 
characteristics associated with demographic. Any 
analysis or model development should be approached 
with caution, ensuring transparency about the 
potential for bias and taking steps to mitigate 
these effects. This dataset was used to show systemic bias 
based on sensitive characteristics. We do not recommend utilizing this dataset to earnestly predict 
attributes such as net worth due to the bias that would entail and this dataset should 
not be employed in any decision-making based on these attributes.

## Processing non-Graph Information
To see a rough version of the code used to take the original dataset csv and
merge them into a full dataset please see `data_merging_and_processing/data.ipynb`. 
Here one can find a jupyter notebook (made and utilized in Google Colab) that processed the original data files and merged them
into `full_with_ed.csv` and the process of encoding features from `full_with_ed.csv` into numerical features in `encoded_data.csv`

### Description
This project involves extensive data processing and manipulation for a dataset related to [specific domain, e.g., U.S. Congress data]. The data encompasses various aspects such as education details, net worth, social media presence, and other personal attributes of individuals associated with the domain.

### Data Sources
The data is sourced from multiple CSV files, which are processed and merged to form a comprehensive dataset. The sources include:

- Education data
- Net worth information
- Social media profiles
- Biographic Information

### Data Processing Steps
The Jupyter notebook `data.ipynb` contains all the data processing logic, which includes:

1. **Data Loading**: CSV files are loaded into pandas DataFrames for manipulation.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Various cleaning operations are performed, such as:
    - Standardizing string fields (e.g., Twitter handles).
    - Dropping unnecessary rows and columns.
    - Handling missing values by filtering or filling them.
3. **Data Merging**: Data from different sources are combined based on common attributes.
4. **Data Deduplication**: Duplicate entries are identified and removed to ensure data integrity.
5. **Data Extraction**: Regular expressions are used to extract structured data from text fields.
6. **Data Transformation**: The data undergoes transformations to ensure it is in a usable format for analysis, including:
    - Merging related columns.
    - Splitting columns into more granular parts.
    - Aggregating information where necessary.
7. **Data Storage**: The processed data is saved into a clean CSV file for downstream analysis or modeling.

### Output
The final output is a cleaned and consolidated dataset stored as `encoded_data.csv` which can be utilized for further analysis or modeling tasks.

### Dependencies

Minority religions in Congress (in this case for this dataset that is Jewish or Other) were encoded with a 1. Majority religious groups which were Unknown and Christianity have value 0. 

13. **numeric_id**
    - Type: Integer
    - Description: A numeric identifiers corresponding to member twitter handles. It is used in the Graph node data.

## Processing Graph Dataset
To make the `data_merging_and_processing/original_datafiles/CongressionalTwitterNetwork` into a format parsable 
by `dig\fairgraph` we applied some processing methodology

### connections_weights.json
`connections_weights.json` is a subset of the original congressional data from the `Congress Twitter Network`. 
It contains the nodes for the relevant members based on their presence in the biographic data file `full_with_ed.csv`.
The file is created with `data_merging_and_processing/graph_subset.py`, a rough processing Python script to isolate the relevant members via Twitter handles.


### cng_relationship.txt
This file contains the node relationships relevant for our subset in a format compatible with Graphair.
Each line is structured as source_id\ttarget_id\n, indicating the relationships between entities using numeric IDs.
It was created using `data_merging_and_processing/graph_relationship.py` and one can find the username and numeric id mapping in the Python file `data_merging_and_processing/get_mapping.py`
